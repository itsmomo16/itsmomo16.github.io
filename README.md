<h1> Hi! I'm Mohammad.</h1>
I'm a motivated and detail-oriented student software engineer with a strong foundation in programming, financial technology, and artificial intelligence. I’m proficient in languages like C++, Python, and Java, and I have experience building finance-related projects, including low-latency trading systems and algorithmic trading models. I’m knowledgeable about financial markets, data analysis, and quantitative methods, and I’ve applied AI and machine learning techniques for predictive modeling, data-driven decision-making, and automation in finance. I take pride in writing clean, efficient code and am eager to contribute to cutting-edge projects at the intersection of finance, AI, and software engineering.
